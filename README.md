# Python-C-CPP

This repository contains examples for using C and C++ libraries from Python,
and on using Python code (callbacks or arbitrary scripts) from C and C++.

Each directory illustrates a particular scenario,
and has both a C or C++ executable (called `main`)
and a Python script (called `demo.py`)
that demonstrate the usage of the scenario.

## 1. Basic C library usage

This example shows how a C library can be used from within Python,
without any additional tools or coding in C.

## 2. Manually created extension module

This example shows how a C extension module can be created,
so that it can simple be imported and used from within Python.
